## My Reading Feed
This web app has pages that feeds articles from sites the author regularly reads. The feed uses an RSS service.

There are 4 html files -
- index.html: main page with general news feeds and clocks (housed in an invisible table), with bootstrap used for header and menu items
- cricket.html - includes cricket-related news feeds
- movies.html - includes movies-related news feeds
- conversation.html - includes articles from The Conversation portal
and 3 CSS files - 

- main.css - used for styling all the html pages, includes media query - clocks disapper for smaller screens
- style.css - used for demonstrating scss and css compilation
- style.scss

Per rubric the above app project satisfies all requirements.


## Motivation
The motivation is two-fold: to learn through the CS50 course the basics of web development & to create a one-stop landing area for the author's reading requirements.
